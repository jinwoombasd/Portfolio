          <h2>Mixing for a Visiting Worship Team</h2>
          <p class="blog-date">Posted recently</p>
          <p>
            Mixing for a visiting worship team was a real highlight for me recently. It was a refreshing change of pace from my usual Sunday routine. Since the team brought their own full band, vocalists, and stage layout, I had to step out of my comfort zone and adapt quickly to a completely new setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main job was running FOH and making sure the blend between the band and the vocal ensemble translated well in the room. Since they were not used to our venue, soundcheck was critical. Our sanctuary tends to be pretty boomy in the low end, so I had to be proactive with EQ by cleaning up the bass, kick, and keys to keep things from getting muddy. I also spent time with the band leader to get a feel for their dynamic style so I would not be caught off guard during transitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We did hit a snag during rehearsal when feedback started creeping in as the vocalists moved downstage. Instead of panicking, I just focused on identifying the frequency, cutting it, and slightly adjusting the monitors. It was a good reminder that live sound is unpredictable, and keeping a cool head is just as important as knowing the gear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because I had such a short window to build trust with a new team, clear communication was everything. By the time the service started, the mix felt locked in, and the band told me they felt fully supported on stage, which is the best feedback I could ask for. This experience gave me a lot more confidence to handle touring groups and showed me that being a good engineer is as much about people skills as it is about faders.

          <h2>Designing the "Torn and Restored" Card Effect</h2>
          <p class="blog-date">Posted recently</p>
          <p>
            I recently stepped away from the live console to dive into some sound design for a magic trick called the Torn and Restored card routine. Unlike the adrenaline of live mixing where you have to decide in a split second, this project let me slow down, zoom in, and really shape the texture of a sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal was to create two distinct sounds: the tear and the restoration. For the tear, I recorded myself ripping cards at different speeds and angles. It was fascinating to hear how a slight change in hand position could make a rip sound either crisp and sharp or soft and fibrous. Sorting through these takes taught me just how much character hides in the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            The restoration sound was the tricky part. Instead of relying on a bunch of external plugins, I decided to build it entirely from the original tear recordings. I took three different clips, reversed them, and layered them so the energy felt like it was pulling together rather than pulling apart. With some volume shaping and tight fades, the reversed clips blended into one clean, magical whoosh without sounding fake.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project really sharpened my ears. I learned that a tiny fade or a millisecond shift in timing can completely change the emotional impact of a cue. It was a great reminder that sound design is a mix of technical precision and creative intuition. Sometimes the simplest raw audio, edited thoughtfully, creates the most convincing magic.
