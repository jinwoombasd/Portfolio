          <h2>Mixing for a Visiting Worship Team</h2>
          <p class="blog-date">Posted recently</p>
          <p>
            One of the most meaningful live sound experiences I had this semester was serving as the Front of House engineer for a visiting worship team performing at my church. Although I had mixed for regular services before, this event introduced new challenges because the team brought in their own musicians, vocalists, and stage setup. It required quick adaptation, active communication, and a high level of technical awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main responsibility was to manage the FOH mix and ensure that both the band and the vocal ensemble blended clearly in the room. Since the group was unfamiliar with our venue, the soundcheck became a crucial process. The acoustic characteristics of the sanctuary often emphasize low frequencies, so I needed to adjust EQ on the bass, kick drum, and keyboard pads to prevent muddiness. I also worked closely with the team's leader to understand their preferred dynamic style and transitions between songs.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges occurred during rehearsal when a few vocal mics started feeding back as the singers moved closer to the front of the stage. I had to quickly identify the problematic frequency range, pull back the offending frequencies, and slightly reposition the monitors. This moment reminded me how unpredictable live sound can be and how important it is to stay calm and react efficiently. Rather than panicking, I focused on listening, analyzing, and communicating clearly with the performers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project helped me grow not only technically but also as a collaborator. Because the team was visiting, I had to build trust with them within a very short time. Clear communication, respectful listening, and patience made the entire process smoother. By the time the event began, the mix felt balanced, and the team expressed how supported they felt on stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, I believe this experience will help me handle touring situations and outside groups with greater confidence. Every venue, every team, and every show is different. This event strengthened my ability to adapt quickly, solve problems under pressure, and create an environment where artists can perform at their best.

          <h2>Designing the "Torn and Restored" Card Effect</h2>
          <p class="blog-date">Posted recently</p>
          <p>
            For my second reflection, I focused on creating a sound effect for a "Torn and Restored" card magic routine. Unlike live mixing, which requires real-time decisions, this project allowed me to slow down, experiment with texture, and shape a sound that supports a specific moment in a performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal was to design two key sounds: the card tearing and the restoration. To capture the tearing sound, I recorded multiple takes of real card rips, each with slightly different speed and angle. Some takes produced sharp, crisp textures, while others sounded softer and more fibrous. Sorting through these small variations taught me how sensitive sound design can be, and how much character comes from subtle performance changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The restoration sound was the most challenging part. Instead of using external effects, I created it entirely from the same card-tear recordings. I selected three clips from different tear takes, reversed them, and arranged them in sequence so the energy felt like it was pulling inward rather than ripping apart. Adjusting the volume shape, adding gentle fades, and tightening the timing helped the reversed clips blend into one smooth movement. The final effect felt clean, quick, and magical without relying on unrelated sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I learned most from this project is how much detail matters. A tiny fade, a slightly shorter clip, or a slight shift in timing can completely change the emotional impact of a cue. This process strengthened my editing workflow and pushed me to trust my ear when shaping delicate sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, building the Torn and Restored effect taught me that sound design is both technical and intuitive. It showed me how a simple idea can become meaningful through careful listening and thoughtful editing, and it expanded my understanding of how sound supports storytelling in performance.
